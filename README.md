An App to list and visualize the number of planes currently flying captured by the OpenSky Network 

### Variable naming
The variable naming is inspired by tidy data. Values are "column names" e.g Country longtitude, latitude. Observations are the measurements. A filterableValue is a value you can use to  filter. A filter is a filterableValue to an array of Observations. Filterables are possible filters.

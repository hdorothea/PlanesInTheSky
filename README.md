# Planes over Brooklyn

An App to list and visualize the number of planes currently flying over Brooklyn. Written to learn React/Redux. Using the [The OpenSky Network API](https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/index.html) 

Honestly the data presented here and the way it presented is pretty useless. I just wanted to make anything dashboard like with live data using React/Redux while doing as little data munging/cleaning as possible.
